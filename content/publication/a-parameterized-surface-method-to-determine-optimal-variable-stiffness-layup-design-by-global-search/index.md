abstract: We propose a method related to the level-set method to find optimal
  steered fibre or variable stiffness (VS) designs for composite laminates. In
  order to steer the fibres, iso-contour lines of an artificial surface, defined
  over a 2D geometry domain, are used. The artificial surface is based on a
  spline approach using a relatively small number of control points. This
  ensures the smoothness of the artificial surface which can help guarantee
  continuity/smoothness of the obtained fibre paths. The tangents of the
  iso-contours of this surface are projected on a structure mesh as fibre angles
  and the desired structural response is computed; in our case the critical
  buckling load or a point displacement. To ensure certain manufactural
  properties of the fibre angle design, the average fibre curvature is
  constrained. Because of the relatively small number of control points we can
  use global optimisers; such as evolutionary algorithms, or swarm based
  options, e.g. Ant Colony optimisation. Results of two example problems show an
  improved performance with a constraint on average curvature. Future
  possibilities are discussed.
