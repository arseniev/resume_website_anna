abstract: The main focus of this paper is the development of an adaptive wingbox
  model and its application to a structural wing optimization. The developed
  model can be fitted to virtually any external aerodynamic wing shape, which is
  defined by a set of parametrized NACA airfoils. Different parameters of the
  internal wing structure e.g. number and location of ribs/spars/stringers,
  their shape parameters and thicknesses can be varied automatically. As the
  first step, a sampling-based sensitivity study is performed to determine the
  importance of design parameters for the defined structural performance
  measures.
