abstract: This work is focused on further development of optimization approaches
  for improving the design of civil aircraft wingbox structures. Several
  optimization approaches are proposed in this thesis, suitable for global
  structural optimization of the wingbox layout, shape optimization of wingbox
  subcomponents and optimal design of steered-fiber composite parts. The
  parametric structural model of the wing with internal wingbox structure allows
  significant changes of the internal components layout and adapts automatically
  to the given wing outer shape. Combined with structural static and buckling
  analysis together with simplified aerodynamic simulations, the model allows to
  use global search methods for preliminary layout of wingbox internal
  structure. Some attention is also paid to the wing box subcomponents
  optimization using submodeling. In particular, a special parametrization
  technique is introduced, which enables topology-like optimization of the
  planar ribs. In addition, a novel method for parametrization and optimization
  of steered-fiber composite parts is proposed within this work. Fiber angle at
  each point of the design space is defined to be tangential to a
  passing-through iso-contour line of an artificial surface. Using a set of
  control points distributed over the design space, the shape of the artificial
  surface can be varied, thus also varying the fiber paths. The method is able
  to accurately handle maximum curvature constraint for multi-layered
  fiber-steered composites, where the maximum curvature can differ among the
  layers.
