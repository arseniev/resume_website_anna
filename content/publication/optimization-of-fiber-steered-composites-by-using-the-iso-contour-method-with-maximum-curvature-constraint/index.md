abstract: The paper presents a novel method for the optimization of
  fiber-steered composite shell structures, considering manufacturability
  constraints, expressed in terms of maximum allowed curvature - maximum fiber
  curvature constraint (MFCC). Unlike the average fiber curvature constraint
  (AFCC), the method is able to capture local effects, guaranteeing the
  manufacturability of the optimal design. In this research, the previously
  introduced iso-contour method, where the fiber paths are represented as
  iso-contour lines of an artificial surface, defined over the 2D geometry
  domain, is extended by a technique to compute the maximum fiber curvature. The
  method is successfully tested with exemplary problems, including the
  optimization of the clamped plate stiffness and design of the fuselage panel
  for maximum buckling force. Results show, that the introduced method can
  precisely control the maximum curvature constraint during the fiber-steered
  composite optimization, and obtained designs provide significant improvement
  over simple laminates.
