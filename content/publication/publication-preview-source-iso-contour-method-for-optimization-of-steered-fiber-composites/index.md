abstract: "The research presented in this paper is focused on a method for
  optimization of fiber-steered composite shell structures. The main idea of
  this method is related to the level-set method: in order to steer the fibers,
  iso-contour lines of an artificial hyper-surface, defined over a 2D geometry
  domain, are used. Thus, the smoothness of this artificial surface can
  guarantee continuity/smoothness of the obtained fiber paths. This can be used
  to create manufacturable steered fiber composites. Finally, by modifying this
  artificial surface, we can control the fiber paths and optimize the design of
  a composite part for the specific needs."
